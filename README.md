# SMS Spam Classifier

This project presents an SMS Spam Classifier built using machine learning techniques in Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to automatically detect and filter out spam messages from legitimate SMS (ham) messages, providing a practical solution to text message spam.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Loads and prepares SMS message data, handling noise and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Extraction:** Converts text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words).
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Implements and compares various classification algorithms for spam detection.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Guides users from data loading to final predictions in a clear and reproducible manner within Jupyter Notebooks.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive code, analysis, and documentation.
- **Python** – For scripting and model development.
- **scikit-learn** – For machine learning algorithms and metrics.
- **Pandas, NumPy** – For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – For visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/not-saad-zahid/Sms-Spam-Classifier.git
    ```
2. Open the notebooks with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to explore the data, train models, and test the SMS spam classifier.

## Dataset

The project uses a publicly available SMS spam dataset (such as [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)). See the notebook for details on downloading and preparing the dataset.
